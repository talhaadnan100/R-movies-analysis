## Movie Analysis

### Motivation

As long as I can remember, movies have held an important place in my life, and in the lives of most people I have come across. There is hardly any corner of the world that has not been exposed to the likes of Star Wars, Harry Potter, Jurrasic Park, or what have you.

This lead me to dig a big deeper in to the the distributors and the industry's biggest successes. Let me share what I've found.

### Findings
